## About me

Having started my career as a professional football player in a local team, I changed my career path on web development.
Interest in technologies led me to working as a Front End Developer.

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth,
besides there’s a huge amount of free high quality resources for self-education and a large community of developers.

I believe, that my ability to learn and to gain new skills will lead me through this path of becoming a proficient Frontend Developer.

## Code Example

Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (Just like the name of this Kata). Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces. Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

```javascript
function spinWords(word) {
    const LIMIT = 100
    let splitedWords = word.split(" ", LIMIT);
    for (let i = 0; i < splitedWords.length; i++) {
        let word = splitedWords[i]
        if (word.length >= 5) {
            splitedWords[i] = word.split("").reverse().join("");
        }
    }
  return word = splitedWords.join(" ");
}
```
